# AI-ML
## Artificial Intelligence
**Creation of Intelligent Machines.**
- Programming machines to exhibit intelligence.
- Machine identifying patterns and learning by itself.
### Programming machines Examples:
**Knowledge-based AI**\
Expert Systems --> Suggesting what to do based on our questions and answers, like a docter.\
Reasoning.\
**Machine Exhibiting Intelligence** in Uncertain Environments like predicting weather conditions.\
**Search-based AI** --> AI in Google Maps or Solving Puzzles.
## Machine Learning
**A subfield of AI that gives computers the ability to learn itself by identifying patterns from the Data we provide using different ML Algorithms without being explicitly programmed**.

The best example for this is ***Personalized Suggestions*** in ecommerce websites or social media based on the user likes and interests, Voice recognization and Face recognization also good examples of ML.

**Data** --> Any information that is stored is called Data.
- Image, Text file, Video, Emails, Messages, etc.

Data --> ML Software --> Program(Intelligent)

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is part of ML, it deals with huge volumes of data to identify the underlying patterns in it.\
It is also called as Artificial Neural Networks.
- Artificial Neural Networks are based on the ideas of how the human brain works.

Tryout the Google [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to understand how ML Software takes data and create a program to give the predicted output using prediction function.

## Data Science
Data Science is the science of **extracting knowledge and insights from data**.
