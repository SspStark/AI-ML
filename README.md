# AI-ML
## Artificial Intelligence
**Creation of Intelligent Machines.**
- Programming machines to exhibit intelligence.
- Machine identifying patterns and learning by itself.
### Programming machines Examples:
**Knowledge-based AI**\
Expert Systems --> AI Suggesting what to do based on our questions and answers, like a docter.\
Reasoning.\
**Machine Exhibiting Intelligence** in Uncertain Environments like predicting weather conditions.\
**Search-based AI** --> AI in Google Maps or Solving Puzzles.
## Machine Learning
**A subfield of AI that gives computers the ability to learn itself by identifying patterns from the Data we provide using different ML Algorithms without being explicitly programmed**.

The best example for this is ***Personalized Suggestions*** in ecommerce websites or social media based on the user likes and interests, Voice recognization and Face recognization also good examples of ML.
## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is part of ML, it deals with huge volumes of data to identify the underlying patterns in it.\
It is also called as Artificial Neural Networks.
- Artificial Neural Networks are based on the ideas of how the human brain works.

Tryout the Google [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to understand how ML Software takes data and create a program to give the predicted output using prediction function.
## Data Science
Data Science is the science of **extracting knowledge and insights from data**.
### Data for ML
**Data** --> Any information that is stored is called Data.
- Image, Text file, Video, Emails, Messages, etc.

Machine Learning have certain Algorithms, when these Algorithms written as **code** is called ML Software.

Data --> ML Software --> Intelligent Program (or) ML Model (or) Prediction function.

“Prediction” refers to the output of an algorithm after it has been trained on a historical dataset and applied to new data when forecasting the likelihood of a particular outcome.

**Types of Data**
- Structured Data
- Unstructured Data
- Labeled Data
- Unlabeled Data

**Structured Data**
- Any data that can be displayed in rows and columns.
- Easy to analyze, Ex: sensors data, app data, network data, e-commerce data, etc.
- Each row is called as an instace (or) an example (or) a sample.
- Each column is called as Feature (or) Attribute.

**Unstructured Data**
- Images, audio, video, text,...
- Can't be analyzed using regular methods using for structured data.
- 80% of enterprise data is unstructured.
- To make computations easier, unstructured data is transformed into ***matrices***.

**Labeled data**
- data labeling is the process of identifying raw data (images, text files, videos, etc.) and adding one or more meaningful and informative labels to provide context so that a machine learning model can learn from it. (or) simply, Labeled data is carefully annotated with meaningful tags, or labels, that classify the data's elements or outcomes.
- For example, in a dataset of emails, each email might be labeled as "spam" or "not spam." These labels then provide a clear guide for a machine learning algorithm to learn from.
- The column which has to be predicted is called as Target Feature (or) Target Attribute (or) Target Variable (or) Target Label.
### Types of ML
**Supervised Learning**
- Learning a **Prediction Function** that **maps** *Input* with *Output* using labelled Data.
- **Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. The model is trained on input-output pairs, and its goal is to map input data to the correct output based on the provided examples. This enables the model to generalize its learning to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Example: Youtube or Instagram recommend shorts or reels based on the data of your previously watched and liked shorts and reels to make you keep watching and spending more time on it so that they will benefit and you will waste your time and ruin your future.
